# Proof for derived triple:
#   :Socrates a :Mortal .
# It holds because the following instance of the rule body is provable:
#   :Socrates a :Human .
#   :Human rdfs:subClassOf :Mortal .
# via the schematic forward rule:
#   {
#     ?S a ?A .
#     ?A rdfs:subClassOf ?B .
#   } => {
#     ?S a ?B .
#   } .
# with substitution (on rule variables):
#   ?A = :Human
#   ?B = :Mortal
#   ?S = :Socrates
# Therefore the derived triple above is entailed by the rules and facts.
